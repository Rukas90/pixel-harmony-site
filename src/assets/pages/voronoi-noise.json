        "Description": "Generates Voronoi noise, also known as Worley noise. This type of noise is based on a grid of points, with each pixel in the image getting a value based on its distance from the nearest point. This creates a cellular pattern that can be used to generate textures resembling marble, stone, and other natural materials."

Each point in the noise pattern is assigned a color from the gradient based on its value, with low values taking colors from one end of the gradient and high values from the other end.",
